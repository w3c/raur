			<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This document outlines various accessibility related user needs, requirements and scenarios for Real&#45;time communication (RTC). These user needs should drive accessibility requirements in various related specifications and the overall architecture that enables it. It first introduces a definition of RTC as used throughout the document and outlines how RTC accessibility can support the needs of people with disabilities. It defines the term user needs as used throughout the document and then goes on to list a range of these user needs and their related requirements. Following that some quality related scenarios are outlined and finally a data table that maps the user needs contained in this document to related use case requirements found in other technical specifications.</p>

<p>This document is most explicitly not a collection of baseline requirements. It is also important to note that some of the requirements may be implemented at a system or platform level, and some may be authoring requirements.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			                

		<h3> What is Real&#45;time communication (<abbr title="Real&#45;time communication">RTC</abbr>)? </h3>
<p>The traditional data exchange model is client to server. Real&#45;time communication (<abbr title="Real&#45;time communication">RTC</abbr>) is game-changing as it is enabled in part by specifications like <abbr title="Web Real&#45;time communication">WebRTC</abbr> that provides real-time peer to peer audio, video and data exchange directly between supported user agents. This enables instantaneous applications for video and audio calls, text chat, file exchange, screen sharing and gaming, all without the need for browser plugins. However, <abbr title="Web Real&#45;time communication">WebRTC</abbr> is not the sole specification with responsibility to enable accessible real-time communications, as use cases and requirements are broad - as outlined in the <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr> RFC 7478 'Web Real-Time Communication Use Cases and Requirements' document. [[ietf-rtc]]</p>


<section>

<h3>Real&#45;time communication and accessibility </h3>
<p><abbr title="Real&#45;time communication">RTC</abbr> has the potential to allow improved accessibility features that will support a broad range of user needs for people with a wide range of disabilities. These needs can be met through improved audio and video quality, audio routing, captioning, improved live transcription, transfer of alternate formats such as sign-language, text-messaging / chat, real time user support and status polling.</p>

<p>Accessible <abbr title="Real&#45;time communication">RTC</abbr> is enabled by a combination of technologies and specifications such as those from the Media Working Group, Web and Networks IG, Second Screen, and Web Audio Working group as well as <abbr title="Accessibility Guidelines Working Group">AGWG</abbr> and <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr>. <abbr title="Accessible Platforms Architecure Working Group">APA</abbr> hopes this document will inform how these groups meet various responsibilities for enabling accessible <abbr title="Real&#45;time communication">RTC</abbr>, as well updating related use cases in various groups. For examples, view the current work on <abbr title="Web Real&#45;time communication">WebRTC</abbr> Next Version Use Cases First Public Working Draft. [[webrtc-use-cases]]</p>

<h3>User needs definition</h3>
<p>This document outlines various accessibility related user needs for Accessible <abbr title="Real&#45;time communication">RTC</abbr>. These user needs should drive accessibility requirements for Accessible <abbr title="Real&#45;time communication">RTC</abbr> and its related architecture.</p>

<p>User needs are presented here with their related requirements; some in a range of scenarios (which can be thought of as similar to user stories). User needs and requirements are being actively reviewing by <abbr title="Research Questions Task Force">RQTF</abbr>/<abbr title="Accessible Platforms Architecure Working Group">APA</abbr>.</p>
		</section>

<li><strong>REQ 9a:</strong> Provide or ensure support for video relay and remote interpretation services. This user need may relate to interoperability with third&#45;party services;  <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr> has looked at standardizing a way to use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) with VRS services. [[ietf-relay]] VRS calls may be made between ASL (American Sign Language) users and hearing persons speaking either English or Spanish.</li>
</ul>
</section>

		<section>

<h3>Distinguishing sent and received text with <abbr title="Real&#45;time text">RTT</abbr></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Need 10:</strong> A deaf or deaf blind user needs to tell the difference between incoming text and outgoing text.

<ul>
<li><strong>User Need 13: </strong> Users with cognitive disabilities may need assistance when using audio or video communication. </li>
 <li><strong>REQ 13a:</strong> Ensure a <abbr title="Web Real&#45;time communication">WebRTC</abbr> video call can host a technical or user support channel.</li>
  <li><strong>REQ 13b:</strong> Provide support that is customised to the needs of the user.</li>
</ul>

		</section>

		<section>

<h3>Personalized symbol sets for users with cognitive disabilities</h3>

  <li><strong>REQ 14a:</strong> Provide personalization support for symbols set replacements of existing user interface rendering of current functions or controls.</li>
</ul>


</section>

<section>

	<h3>Internet relay chat (<abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>) style interfaces required by blind users</h3>
		

<ul>
<li><strong>User Need 15: </strong> To translate text to speech interactions into comprehensible speech; a blind screen reader user depending on <abbr title="Text to Speech">TTS</abbr> to interact with their computers and smart devices needs a traditional Internet Relay Chat (IRC) style interface.</li>

	  <li><strong>REQ 15a:</strong> Preserve <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> as a configuration option in agents that implement <abbr title="Web Real&#45;time communication">WebRTC</abbr> as opposed to having only the Real&#45;time text (<abbr title="Real&#45;time text">RTT</abbr>) type interface. While (<abbr title="Real&#45;time text">RTT</abbr>) is very imporant it is favoured by users who are deaf or hearing impaired.  For screen reader users, <abbr title="Text to Speech">TTS</abbr> cannot reasonably translate text into comprehensible speech unless the characters to be pronounced are transmitted in very close timing to one another. Typical gaps will result in stuttering and highly unintelligible output from the <abbr title="Text to Speech">TTS</abbr> engine.</p>



<h4>Braille users and <abbr title="Real&#45;time text">RTT</abbr></h4>

<p>Some braille users will also prefer the <abbr title="Real&#45;time text">RTT</abbr> model. However, braille users desiring text displayed with standard contracted braille might better be served in the manner users relying on text to speech (<abbr title="Text to Speech">TTS</abbr>) engines are served, by buffering the data to be transmitted until an end of line character is reached.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
<h3>Deaf users: Video resolution and frame rates</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>User Need 15: </strong> A deaf user watching a signed broadcast needs a high&#45;quality frame rate to maintain legibility and clarity in order to understand what is being signed.</strong>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> EN 301 549 Section 6,  recommends  <abbr title="Web Real&#45;time communication">WebRTC</abbr> applications should support a frame rate of at least 20 frames per second (FPS). More details can be found at <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf"> Accessible Procurement standard for ICT products and services EN 301 549 (PDF)</a></p>

	<h2>Quality of service scenarios</h2>



<section>
	<h3>Bandwidth for audio </h3>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A hard of hearing user needs better stereo sound to have a quality experience in work calls or meetings with friends or family. Transmission aspects, such as decibel range for audio needs to be of high&#45;quality. For calls, industry allows higher audio resolution but still mostly in mono only. </p>

</section>

<section>

<h3>Bandwidth for video </h3>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A hard of hearing user needs better stereo sound so they can have a quality experience in watching HD video or having a HD meeting with friends or family. Transmission aspects, such as frames per minute for video quality needs to be of high&#45;quality.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> EN 301 549 Section 6,  recommends for <abbr title="Web Real&#45;time communication">WebRTC</abbr> enabled conferencing and communication the application shall be able to encode and decode communication with a frequency range with an upper limit of at least 7KHz. More details can be found at <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf"> Accessible Procurement standard for ICT products and services EN 301 549 (PDF)</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <abbr title="Web Real&#45;time communication">WebRTC</abbr> lets applications prioritise bandwidth dedicated to audio / video / data streams; there is also some experimental work in signalling these needs to the network layer as well as support for prioritising frame rate over resolution in case of congestion.
